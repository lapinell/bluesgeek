                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This competition is for anyone who has never made finals in a partnered blues competition of any level before. If you *have* made finals in a partnered blues competition, head on over to the Open Idiom Mix’n’Match! In the prelims of the novice idiom competition, you’ll be dancing with fellow competitors (paired randomly and rotated), but in finals, you’ll be paired with one of our super fun “pros” to strut your stuff. </p>

                <h2>Qualifications</h2>
                <p>You’ll be competing in three different idiom dances, which we’ll select and announce ahead of time. And the best part is, the novice competition happens on Sunday, so you’ll have gotten a whole weekend of practice in the idiom dances you’re competing in!</p>
